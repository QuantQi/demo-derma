              <p className="text-dark-grey leading-relaxed">
                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when

              <p className="text-dark-grey leading-relaxed">
                Like most website operators, MB Derma collects non-personally-identifying information of the 
                sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, 
                language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
              </p>
              <p className="text-dark-grey leading-relaxed">
                MB Derma's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand 
                how MB Derma's visitors use its website. From time to time, MB Derma may release 
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on 
                trends in the usage of its website.

              <p className="text-dark-grey leading-relaxed">
                Certain visitors to MB Derma's website choose to interact with MB Derma in ways that require 
                MB Derma to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 
                MB Derma gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
              </p>
              <p className="text-dark-grey leading-relaxed">
                For example, we ask visitors who book consultations to provide their name, email address, 
                and phone number. In each case, MB Derma collects such information only insofar as is necessary 
                or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with MB Derma.
